For them, the transition to retirement was scary and riddled with important decisions. Furthermore, they wanted to live the lifestyle they desired, and needed assurance that this was possible. We helped by creating a retirement income projection to illustrate monthly income during retirement. From there, we constructed an investment portfolio that supported the monthly retirement income and future goals set out in the retirement income projection. With our help, our client was able to then make decisions about pension election choices, Social Security options, company 401(k) rollovers, and health insurance coverage.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Saver<\/h3>\n<p>Our clients have been saving the maximum allowed in their company 401(k) plans for retirement. However, they realized that they have other financial concerns, such as college savings, life insurance, and emergency savings. They were not sure how to prioritize their money. We created a vision for their saving and an order of priority for their financial needs. They were then able to move forward with purchasing life insurance for survivorship income. They also established investment accounts outside of their 401(k)s for both college and emergency savings using auto deposits, and refinanced the mortgage on their home.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Business Owner<\/h3>\n<p>Our clients own and manage a profitable business. Over the course of our long-term relationship, we advised them on business succession issues. The result was a signed buy-sell agreement drafted by their attorney and funding of the agreement using life insurance. Competitive employee group benefits were established, along with a process to determine business cash distributions, reinvestment of business cash, and a recurring cash dividend for shareholders. With the future of the business clear, the business owners were able to move forward with their estate planning knowing that the illiquidity of the business had been solved.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Review our financial planning services<\/h4>\n<h5>Financial Planning<\/h5>\n<h4>Personal<\/h4>\n<p>Your financial needs change at all stages of life.
